high-level overview; if you want to learn about it in detail feel free to read my full thesis

replicating from scratch gu kelly xu since they dont provide any code; and extend der analyses;

dataset of stocks with characteristics and returns for each month; rolling window approach to predict returns based on historical information; use different machine learning models

at the end of each month we can for each stock predicht the return for the upcomming month; sort stocks according to their predicted return; go long in upper 10 percent; go short in lower 10 percent; this is called decile spread portfolio

so this is what gu kelly xu did

i extend it: because i look also at after cost performance; crucial because very high turnover leading to high transaction costs
