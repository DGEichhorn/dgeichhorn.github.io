My name is Dominik and I am a statistician. 
I love working with data, solving complex problems, and turning insights into impact.

My journey has taken me from studying maths and business at TUM to diving deep into  statistics and machine learning. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Chair of Statistics at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich.
I have already had the opportunity to gather some practical experience through internships (e.g. at Allianz) and project work (PwC in cooperation with TUM Data Innovation Lab).

For me, work is most fun when you develop together data-driven solutions and put them into practice. I love expanding my skills continuously, e.g., by taking online courses or reading scientific literature on topics that are new to me.

In my leisure time, I enjoy rowing in a crew, cooking, travelling and reading.
